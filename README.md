Probability of Default Prediction to Estimate Gross Credit Loss



Gross credit loss refers to the total amount of money that a lender or financial institution expects to lose due to credit defaults within a specified time period. It represents the aggregate value of loans or credit exposures that are not expected to be repaid fully.

The calculation of gross credit loss involves several factors and considerations, including:

Defaulted Loans: Identify the loans or credit exposures that have defaulted or are expected to default within the specified time period. These are the loans where the borrowers have failed to meet their credit obligations, resulting in potential losses for the lender.

Outstanding Loan Balances: Determine the outstanding balance on each defaulted loan or credit exposure. This represents the amount that is still owed by the borrowers at the time of default.

Recovery Rates: Assess the expected recovery rates for the defaulted loans. Recovery rates represent the portion of the outstanding loan balances that the lender anticipates recovering through various means, such as collateral liquidation, legal actions, or debt restructuring.

Loss Given Default (LGD): LGD is the proportion of the outstanding loan balance that the lender expects to lose in the event of default. It accounts for the unrecoverable portion of the loan and is typically expressed as a percentage. LGD can vary based on factors such as collateral quality, loan type, and the effectiveness of recovery efforts.

The calculation of gross credit loss can be summarized using the following formula:

Gross Credit Loss = Sum of (Outstanding Loan Balance * (1 - Recovery Rate) * LGD) for all defaulted loans or credit exposures

By multiplying the outstanding loan balance by (1 - Recovery Rate) and then further multiplying it by the LGD, the calculation estimates the portion of the loan that is likely to result in a loss for the lender.

It's important to note that the calculation of gross credit loss is an estimation and involves inherent uncertainties. Lenders employ various risk management techniques, statistical models, and historical data analysis to project potential losses accurately. These estimates are critical for determining the adequacy of loan loss provisions, assessing credit risk, and making informed lending decisions.
